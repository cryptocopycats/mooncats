It adds functionality for controlling page margins, page size and orientation, and headers and footers, and extends generated content to enable page numbering and running headers / footers... 

- [**CSS Paged-Media @ Mozilla Docs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page) - The `@page` CSS at-rule is used to modify some CSS properties when printing a document. You can't change all CSS properties with `@page`. You can only change the margins, orphans, widows, and page breaks of the document..
